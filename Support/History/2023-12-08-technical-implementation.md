### Technical Implementation
- Migrated from custom AetherSystem to hybrid approach using both RealityKit particles and custom systems
- Implemented PulseSystem for simple, performance-critical effects
- Created NexusSystem for complex, interactive particle behaviors
- Resolved package dependencies and project structure
- Established framework for converting CSS/HTML particle effects to RealityKit
- Optimized project for visionOS 2.0+ with focus on Dolby Atmos support

### Architecture Decisions
- Keeping custom particle system for AlbumVibes due to specific requirements
- Using RealityKit particles for standard effects
- Hybrid approach allows flexibility while maintaining performance
- Modular system design for easy testing and maintenance

### Next Steps
- Complete particle system conversion
- Implement performance optimizations
- Test with multiple simultaneous particle systems
- Verify Dolby Atmos integration
