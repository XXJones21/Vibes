## December 7, 2023 - Coordinate Space and Animation Improvements

### Technical Implementation
- Fixed coordinate space conversion in WelcomeLetterAnimation:
  - Implemented proper RealityKit coordinate space system
  - Fixed scene center point calculation
  - Updated all animation phases to use correct space
- Enhanced stable state animation:
  - Added gentle floating movement
  - Implemented color pulsing
  - Maintained proper text shape
- Improved animation phase transitions:
  - All phases now properly centered
  - Smooth transitions between states
  - Better particle control

### Issues Addressed
1. Coordinate Space Conversion:
   - Problem: Incorrect coordinate space conversion
   - Solution: Implemented proper RealityKit space conversion
   - Used correct protocol conformance

2. Animation Center Point:
   - Problem: Animations not properly centered
   - Solution: Using converted scene center for all phases
   - Fixed position calculations

3. Stable State Animation:
   - Problem: Missing proper floating text effect
   - Solution: Added gentle movement and color pulsing
   - Improved particle control

### Next Steps
- Fix remaining availability attributes
- Implement proper error handling
- Test animation phases with new coordinate system
- Optimize performance
- Add comprehensive documentation
