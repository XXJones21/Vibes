## Package Architecture Improvements

### Technical Implementation
- Created new ParticleTypes.swift to properly expose RealityKit types
- Implemented proper access level management in ParticleSystem
- Added private backing storage for entity management
- Fixed entity hierarchy and lifecycle management
- Added type aliases for RealityKit components

### Type System Enhancements
- Added ColorMode enum for type-safe color configurations
- Added Shape enum for emitter shape management
- Improved particle system configuration API
- Enhanced preset system with proper access levels

### Issues Addressed
1. Access Level Issues:
   - Fixed private/internal protection levels
   - Made necessary types and methods public
   - Added proper computed properties
   - Fixed entity access patterns

2. RealityKit Integration:
   - Added proper type exposure
   - Fixed availability attributes
   - Improved type safety
   - Enhanced error handling

### Solutions Implemented
- Used computed properties for safe entity access
- Added type aliases for RealityKit types
- Implemented proper entity lifecycle management
- Added documentation and type safety improvements
