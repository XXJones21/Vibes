# December 9, 2023 - Component System Refactor

## Changes Made

### AetherParticles System
- Refactored to use component-based registration instead of system-level registration
- Updated NexusComponent and PulseComponent registration patterns
- Fixed access control issues in AetherParticles core types
- Commented out AetherWelcomeAnimation.swift for future update with new component system

### Welcome Sequence
- Simplified WelcomeView to use new component-based system
- Implemented sequential particle effects:
  1. Firefly effect (7 seconds total)
     - 2s fade in
     - 3s full display
     - 2s fade out
  2. Galaxy effect using NexusSystem (10 seconds total)
     - 2s fade in
     - 6s full display
     - 2s fade out

### PulsarSymphony Module
- Reorganized constants from standalone file into PulsarSymphony+Albums extension
- Fixed accessibility issues with Constants enum across extensions
- Improved module organization and encapsulation

## Technical Implementation Details
- Moved from system-level to component-level registration for better lifecycle management
- Implemented proper fade transitions in WelcomeView
- Standardized timing patterns for welcome sequence effects
- Improved code organization in PulsarSymphony module

## Issues Addressed
- Fixed NexusComponent scope and registration issues
- Resolved Constants accessibility across PulsarSymphony extensions
- Addressed component registration pattern in app initialization

## Next Steps
1. Update AetherWelcomeAnimation to work with new component-based system
2. Test and fine-tune welcome sequence timing and effects
3. Complete remaining linter error fixes
4. Verify component cleanup and lifecycle management
