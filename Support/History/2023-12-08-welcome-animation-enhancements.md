### Welcome Animation Enhancements
- Standardized particle system bounds to ±12.5 units
- Improved animation flow and transitions:
  - Globe Formation: Now spawns particles around user space
  - Center Pull: Modified to reuse existing particles
  - Text Formation: Updated with standardized bounds
  - Stable State: Maintained with consistent bounds
  - Final Burst: Enhanced with larger space

### Technical Implementation
- Removed duplicate AetherParticles implementation
- Updated all particle presets to use standardized bounds:
  - Fireflies: 3 → 12.5
  - Galaxy: 8 → 12.5
  - GalaxySplit: 3 → 12.5
  - Sparkles: 3 → 12.5
  - Smoke: 5 → 12.5
  - Rain: 10 → 12.5

### Improvements
- Fixed particle vanishing by expanding boundaries
- Enhanced animation continuity by reusing particles
- Improved code organization and removed redundancy
- Standardized particle system configuration

### Known Issues
- Platform availability linter errors remain
- Animation timing needs verification
- Performance testing needed with new bounds
