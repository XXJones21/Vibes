### Welcome Animation Implementation
- Created detailed welcome animation specification in UX-Design.md
- Implemented WelcomeAnimation class with RealityKit particle system
- Added multi-phase animation sequence (10 seconds total):
  1. Globe Formation: Spherical particle arrangement with perlin noise
  2. Center Pull: Particle compression with swirl effect
  3. Text Formation: Dynamic "VIBES" text rendering
  4. Stable State: Gentle particle oscillation
  5. Final Burst: Explosive dispersion effect
- Implemented performance optimizations:
  - Batch processing for particle updates
  - Efficient memory management
  - Optimized material handling

### Technical Details
- Used UnlitMaterial for better performance
- Implemented particle pooling system
- Added batch processing (50 particles per batch)
- Optimized color transitions and opacity handling
- Added proper cleanup in deinit

### Current Challenges
1. Animation phase transitions need refinement
2. Color handling requires type conversion fixes
3. Performance testing needed with full particle count

### Next Steps
- Fix animation phase enum issues
- Implement proper color transitions
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Conduct performance testing
