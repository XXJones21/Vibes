### Particle System Property Fixes

### Technical Implementation
- Fixed particle property names in AetherParticles:
  - Changed `scale` to `size` for particle dimensions
  - Changed `duration` to `lifeSpan` for particle lifetime
  - Fixed particle emitter configuration
- Verified correct RealityKit API usage
- Updated particle system documentation

### Issues Addressed
1. Particle Visibility:
   - Fixed incorrect property names
   - Implemented proper RealityKit properties
   - Updated configuration system

### Next Steps
- Verify particle visibility in welcome animation
- Consider implementing additional particle features:
  - Size variation for natural effects
  - Lifetime variation for particle dynamics
  - Color evolution for smooth transitions
  - Opacity curves for fade effects
