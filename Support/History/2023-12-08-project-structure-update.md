### Technical Changes
- Renamed `Modules` directory to `TechStacks` for better organization
- Updated project file references to match new structure
- Fixed Xcode/Cursor synchronization issues
- Cleaned up old backups and organized particle system files

### Implementation Details
- Focused on project structure and build system improvements
- Ensured proper file organization for particle systems
- Fixed file references in project.pbxproj

### Current Focus
- Working on AetherParticles migration
- Addressing sync issues between Xcode and Cursor
- Organizing particle system implementation

### Next Steps
- Complete AetherParticles migration
- Test particle system functionality
- Update any remaining import statements

Today we tackled some critical infrastructure issues, primarily focusing on resolving the sync problems between Xcode and Cursor. The main breakthrough was identifying that our recent folder restructuring from `Modules` to `TechStacks` needed proper project file updates. We've successfully saved all changes and verified the project structure is now consistent.

The AetherParticles restructuring remains our highest priority. While today's work on file organization and project references sets us up for success, we still need to complete the migration plan we outlined. The next session will focus on implementing the new directory structure and fixing the remaining build errors in PulseSystem and NexusSystem.
