## December 5, 2023 - WelcomeAnimation Debug Implementation

### Technical Changes
- Added comprehensive debug logging system to WelcomeAnimation:
  - Phase transition logging
  - Progress percentage tracking
  - Color-coded phase visualization
- Fixed animation timing:
  - Added missing spawnDuration constant (1.0s)
  - Verified phase transition timing
  - Added progress tracking for each phase
- Implemented color-coded debugging:
  - Each phase has a distinct color
  - Alpha transitions for fade effects
  - Material system integration

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added visual feedback for animation phases
- Improved phase transition visibility
- Enhanced debugging capabilities

### Issues Addressed
1. Added missing spawnDuration constant:
   - Problem: Undefined duration causing timing issues
   - Solution: Added 1.0s constant aligned with sequence
   
2. Added debug visualization:
   - Problem: Difficult to track animation phases
   - Solution: Implemented color-coding system

3. Enhanced logging:
   - Problem: Limited visibility into animation state
   - Solution: Added comprehensive progress logging
