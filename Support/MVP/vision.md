We are building Vibes as an entertainment app to showcase how music can live around us and create a visual connection with the music they love.  The particle simulations utilize Apple's RealityKit and RealityComposerPro to create unique and personalized immersive experiences with interactive content. By tying into Apple Music's API services, users can listen to vast library of music and content that feature Dolby Atmos for a fully spatialized musical journey. With Apple Music, information from the currently playing song, such as, tempo, genre, beats per mins, release date, are used to power the particle sims to create dazzling effects such as a burst of bubbles for an upbeat pop song with large fireworks, to more outer space and ethereal style of cosmos surrounds you as you listen to an instrumental synth wave song, to even a series of raining clouds above your head, raining down during those sad slow jams. Vibes lets you live in your music.

We are also building Vibes as a supplement application for people who suffer from treatment resistant depression and PTSD and are currently utilizing Ketamine and other legal psychedelic treatments to help lower a patient's "time to bridge" and creates a grounding and immersive experience during there trip.
