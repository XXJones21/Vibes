### Key Components

#### Album Management
```swift
public func fetchAlbums(category: VibesAlbumCategory) async throws -> [AlbumRepresentable] {
    // Cache-first approach
    if let cached = self.albumCache[category] {
        return cached.map(MusicKitAlbum.init)
    }
    let albums = try await fetchMusicKitAlbums(category: category)
    self.albumCache[category] = albums
    return albums.map(MusicKitAlbum.init)
}
```

#### Pagination Implementation
- Created `PaginationState` struct for managing paginated content
- Implemented category-based album fetching with offset support
- Added cache management for improved performance

- Added device capability checking
- Implemented subscription status verification
- Added proper error handling for unsupported devices

### Technical Challenges Addressed

### Welcome Animation Implementation
- Created detailed welcome animation specification in UX-Design.md
- Implemented WelcomeAnimation class with RealityKit particle system
- Added multi-phase animation sequence (10 seconds total):
  1. Globe Formation: Spherical particle arrangement with perlin noise
  2. Center Pull: Particle compression with swirl effect
  3. Text Formation: Dynamic "VIBES" text rendering
  4. Stable State: Gentle particle oscillation
