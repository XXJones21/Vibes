# Current Issues

## Platform Availability
- Several linter errors related to macOS/visionOS availability:
  - ObservableObject
  - Entity
  - Published
  - BoundingBox
  - RealityViewContent
  - Point3D
- Need to verify and update availability attributes

## Animation System
- Animation timing needs verification against UX specs
- Particle counts may need optimization for performance
- Some phases might need fine-tuning:
  - Globe formation initial spread
  - Center pull transition smoothness
  - Text formation particle distribution

## Performance Considerations
- Test increased particle counts impact
- Verify memory usage with expanded bounds
- Monitor frame rate during phase transitions

## Next Steps
1. Address platform availability errors
2. Verify animation timing matches UX design
3. Test and optimize particle system performance
4. Consider implementing additional effects
