# Current Issues

## High Priority

### AetherParticles Restructuring (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### Current Status
- ✅ Moved to component-based registration system
- ✅ Fixed access level issues between components
- ✅ Resolved NexusSystem registration approach
- ✅ Standardized PulseSystem and NexusSystem approaches
- ⚠️ Need to update AetherWelcomeAnimation for new component system
- ⚠️ Need to verify component cleanup and lifecycle management

#### Required Changes

1. Directory Restructuring:
```
AetherParticles/
├── Core/
│   ├── AetherPhysics.swift        # ✅ Moved and integrated
│   ├── AetherParticles.swift      # ✅ Updated for component system
│   ├── AetherConfiguration.swift   # ✅ Access levels fixed
│   └── AetherParticleTypes.swift  # ✅ Access levels fixed
├── Systems/
│   ├── Pulse/
│   │   ├── PulseSystem.swift      # ✅ Updated to component-based
│   │   └── PulseComponent.swift   # ✅ Implemented
│   └── Nexus/
│       ├── NexusSystem.swift      # ✅ Updated to component-based
│       └── NexusComponent.swift   # ✅ Implemented
└── Effects/
    ├── AetherPresets/            # ✅ Updated for new system
    └── AetherAnimations/         # ⚠️ Needs update for component system
```

2. Access Level Updates:
- ✅ Made AetherConfiguration public and accessible
- ✅ Fixed standardBounds accessibility
- ✅ Updated component access levels
- ✅ Verified AetherPhysics access levels

3. System-Specific Changes:

**PulseSystem**
- ✅ Optimized for small, localized effects
- ✅ Updated to use proper type conversions
- ✅ Maintained RealityKit particle system compatibility
- ⚠️ Need to verify performance with multiple instances

**NexusSystem**
- ✅ Maintained complex physics capabilities
- ✅ Fixed component registration
- ✅ Implemented proper lifecycle management
- ⚠️ Need to verify performance at scale

4. Integration Points:
- ✅ Both systems using AetherConfiguration
- ✅ Standardized particle property access
- ✅ Maintained preset compatibility
- ✅ SwiftUI integration working
- ✅ AetherPhysics properly integrated

#### Success Criteria
1. ✅ Clean build with component system
2. ✅ Basic effects working as before
3. ✅ Both systems accessible through AetherParticles
4. ✅ Core functionality maintained
5. ✅ Clear separation between systems
6. ✅ Proper configuration access
7. ⚠️ Need performance verification

#### Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Create new directory structure
2. ✅ Move files to new locations
3. ✅ Update imports and access levels
4. ✅ Fix type conversion issues
5. ✅ Test basic system functionality
6. ✅ Verify basic integration
7. ⚠️ Update documentation
8. ✅ Implement component registration
9. ⚠️ Complete performance testing

## Next Steps
1. Update AetherWelcomeAnimation for component system
2. Test and verify welcome sequence timing
3. Complete performance testing with both systems
4. Update documentation for new architecture
5. Implement proper cleanup in component lifecycle

## Platform Availability
- Several linter errors related to macOS/visionOS availability:
  - ObservableObject
  - Entity
  - Published
  - BoundingBox
  - RealityViewContent
  - Point3D
- Need to verify and update availability attributes
- ⚠️ NEW: Scene.registerSystem availability needs verification

## Animation System
- Animation timing needs verification against UX specs
- Particle counts may need optimization for performance
- Some phases might need fine-tuning:
  - Globe formation initial spread
  - Center pull transition smoothness
  - Text formation particle distribution

## Performance Considerations
- Test increased particle counts impact
- Verify memory usage with expanded bounds
- Monitor frame rate during phase transitions

## December 8, 2023 Update

### Resolved
- ✅ RealityKitContent package integration
- ✅ VibesParticles module dependencies
- ✅ AetherSystem deprecation
- ✅ Project structure cleanup

### Current Focus
- Implement new particle systems using RealityKit
- Optimize performance for multiple simultaneous particle systems
- Complete conversion of remaining CSS/HTML particle effects
- Test particle system performance with 25+ AlbumVibes

## Medium Priority
(existing medium priority issues...)

## Low Priority
(existing low priority issues...)

## Resolved Issues (January 24, 2024)

- ✅ Fixed Xcode/Cursor sync issues by properly saving project file changes
- ✅ Resolved folder structure inconsistencies by renaming `Modules` to `TechStacks`
- ✅ Fixed project file references to match new directory structure

## Current Issues

- ⏳ AetherParticles migration still in progress
- ⚠️ Need to verify all particle system functionality after reorganization
- ⚠️ Some import statements may need updating after structure changes
