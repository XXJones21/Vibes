# Current Issues

## AetherParticles
- Visibility issues being addressed through proper coordinate space conversion
- Implemented fixes:
  - Proper coordinate space conversion with content.convert
  - Fixed scaling and positioning
  - Improved debug visualization
- Remaining to verify:
  - Visibility across different view sizes
  - Performance with large particle counts
  - Cleanup handling
  - Edge case coordinate conversion

## Status
- In Progress: Testing visibility fixes
- Next: Performance monitoring implementation
- Pending: Cleanup handling improvements
