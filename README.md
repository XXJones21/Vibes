# Vibes - Spatial Audio Music Player

A visionOS music player app that creates immersive spatial audio experiences.

## Project Status (December 5, 2023)

The project has made significant progress in debugging and visualization capabilities. The WelcomeAnimation system now features comprehensive debug logging and color-coded phase visualization, making it easier to track and verify the animation sequence. Each phase is distinctly color-coded and includes progress tracking, enhancing development and testing efficiency. Current focus is on resolving color handling and type system issues for visionOS compatibility.

### Current Priorities
1. 🎨 Resolve WelcomeAnimation color system
2. 🌟 Complete animation phase testing
3. ⚡️ Optimize animation performance
4. 🎵 Enhance Gallery view
5. 🎧 Improve MusicService integration

### Upcoming Features
- Enhanced animation debugging
- Seamless phase transitions
- Gallery view improvements
- Optimized performance
- Comprehensive testing suite

## Features

- Music playback integration with Apple Music
