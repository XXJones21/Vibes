### Particle System Improvements
- Fixed particle visibility issues in welcome animation
- Corrected RealityKit particle property implementations:
  - Implemented proper `lifeSpan` for particle duration
  - Implemented proper `size` for particle scale
  - Fixed particle emitter configuration
- Verified correct API usage against RealityKit documentation
- Updated documentation with proper property names and usage

### Next Steps
- Verify particle visibility in welcome animation
- Consider implementing additional particle properties:
  - `sizeVariation` for more natural effects
  - `lifeSpanVariation` for varied particle lifetimes
  - `colorEvolutionPower` for smoother transitions
  - `opacityCurve` for better fade effects
