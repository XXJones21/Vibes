# Current Status

## Welcome Animation
- Improved particle system with standardized bounds (Â±12.5 units)
- Optimized animation phases for more natural transitions
- Particles now spawn around user in globe formation
- Center pull phase reuses existing particles
- Fixed particle vanishing issues with expanded boundaries

## Technical Status
- Removed duplicate AetherParticles implementation
- Standardized particle system bounds across all presets
- Improved animation continuity between phases
- Core functionality maintained with better consistency
- Created detailed MusicService optimization plan
- Established progress tracking system in README

## Known Issues
- Platform availability linter errors need addressing
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning
- Particle counts and emission rates may need adjustment

## In Progress
- Gallery View Enhancement:
  - Improving animations and transitions
  - Adding more dynamic and exciting interactions
  - Fixing animation timing issues
- MusicService Optimization:
  - Created detailed implementation plan in project-planning.md
  - Established phase-based development approach
  - Set up progress tracking in README
- NowPlaying View Development:
  - Initial design and implementation planning
  - Integration with MusicService
  - UI/UX design exploration

## Next Steps
- Address remaining linter errors
- Verify animation timing against UX specifications
- Test performance with increased particle counts
- Consider additional particle effects for other views
