- Fixed access control and registration issues

## In Progress

- Device installation and testing
- Bundle configuration verification
- AetherWelcomeAnimation update for new component system
- Welcome sequence timing and effect refinements
- Component lifecycle management improvements

## Next Steps

1. Complete device testing with new bundle configuration
2. Verify proper component registration with fixed references
3. Update AetherWelcomeAnimation to work with new component-based system
4. Test and fine-tune welcome sequence timing and effects
5. Complete remaining linter error fixes
6. Verify component cleanup and lifecycle management

## Technical Status
- Configured proper bundle identification for visionOS deployment
- Streamlined build phase organization

- Standardized particle system bounds across all presets
- Core functionality maintained with better consistency

## Known Issues
- Device installation bundle validation needs verification
- Platform availability linter errors need addressing
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning
- Particle counts and emission rates may need adjustment

## Previous Updates

### December 8, 2023
- Completed migration of MusicService to PulsarSymphony module structure
