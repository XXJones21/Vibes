## Current Status (December 5, 2023)

### Today's Progress
- âœ… Created UX-Design.md with welcome animation specifications
- âœ… Implemented initial WelcomeAnimation class with particle system
- âœ… Added animation phases with proper timing:
  - Globe Formation (0-3s)
  - Center Pull (3-4s)
  - Text Formation (4-6s)
  - Stable State (6-8s)
  - Final Burst (8-10s)
- âœ… Fixed color handling and material properties
- âœ… Added performance optimizations (batch processing, particle pooling)
