# Current Status

## December 8, 2023
- Completed migration of MusicService to PulsarSymphony module structure
- Successfully moved and updated core types in MusicKitWrappers.swift
- Started updating app views to use new PulsarSymphony module
- Fixed namespace issues in core service files

### In Progress
- Updating app views to use PulsarSymphony (ContentView.swift updated)
- Resolving linter errors related to module imports
- Need to complete view updates for Gallery, Authorization, and other views

### Next Steps
- Complete view updates to use PulsarSymphony
- Resolve remaining linter errors
- Test integration with updated module structure

## Welcome Animation
- Improved particle system with standardized bounds (Â±12.5 units)
- Optimized animation phases for more natural transitions
- Particles now spawn around user in globe formation
- Center pull phase reuses existing particles
- Fixed particle vanishing issues with expanded boundaries

## Technical Status
- Removed duplicate AetherParticles implementation
- Standardized particle system bounds across all presets
- Improved animation continuity between phases
- Core functionality maintained with better consistency

## Known Issues
- Platform availability linter errors need addressing
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning
- Particle counts and emission rates may need adjustment

## Next Steps
- Address remaining linter errors
- Verify animation timing against UX specifications
- Test performance with increased particle counts
- Consider additional particle effects for other views

## December 8, 2023 - Code Cleanup and Organization

### Completed Tasks
- Finalized PulsarSymphony module structure cleanup:
  - Removed outdated package-install.md
  - Cleaned up package references
  - Updated access levels in PulsarSymphony.swift
  - Removed redundant AlbumCategory.swift
  - Streamlined AlbumModels.swift to RealityKit components

### Technical Implementation
- Changed public declarations to internal where appropriate
- Maintained public protocol API requirements
- Properly scoped PlaybackState and its members
- Verified protocol namespace alignment

### Issues Addressed
1. Package References:
   - Removed outdated MusicService package files
   - Verified only RealityKitContent and VibesParticles remain

2. Access Levels:
   - Updated PulsarSymphony properties and methods
   - Maintained necessary public API surface

3. File Organization:
   - Removed redundant types
   - Consolidated model files
   - Verified module structure

### Next Steps
- Address platform availability errors
- Verify animation timing
- Test particle system performance
- Complete remaining project repair tasks

## December 8, 2023 - AetherParticles Migration
- Completed AetherParticles module namespace migration
- Updated all effect files with Aether prefix
- Standardized access levels across module
- Fixed Core file structure and organization

### Completed Tasks
- Core Files Updated:
  - AetherParticles.swift
  - AetherParticleTypes.swift
  - AetherSystem.swift
  - AetherParticlesView.swift

- Effects Files Updated:
  - AetherPresets:
    - AetherFirefliesEffect
    - AetherGalaxyEffect
    - AetherGalaxySplitEffect
    - AetherRainEffect
    - AetherSmokeEffect
    - AetherSparklesEffect
  - AetherAnimations:
    - AetherWelcomeAnimation

### Technical Implementation
- Removed public access modifiers where not needed
- Added Aether prefix to all types
- Standardized naming patterns:
  - Types: AetherColor, AetherShape
  - Enums: AetherState, AetherPreset
  - Configs: AetherConfiguration
- Updated documentation

### Issues Addressed
1. Namespace Consistency:
   - Added Aether prefix to all types
   - Standardized naming conventions
   - Removed redundant public modifiers

2. Module Structure:
   - Core functionality properly organized
   - Effects separated into Presets and Animations
   - System components isolated

3. Access Levels:
   - Internal by default
   - Private where appropriate
   - Public removed unless necessary

### Next Steps
- Address platform availability errors
- Test particle system performance
- Verify animation timing against UX specs
- Implement performance optimizations
