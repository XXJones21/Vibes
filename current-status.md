# Current Status

## Latest Updates (2024-12-13)

### Particle System Improvements
- Fixed particle system visibility and scaling issues
- Implemented proper particle system updates with 60fps timer
- Added scale effect functionality for both fireflies and galaxy effects
- Adjusted particle presets for better visibility and control
- Positioned effects properly in 3D space

### Key Changes
1. Core Updates:
   - Added `scaleEffect` function to PulseParticles
   - Added `adjustEmissionVolume` to PulseEffect protocol
   - Fixed inout parameter issues in particle system updates
   - Added QuartzCore import for proper timing

2. Effect Refinements:
   - Adjusted fireflies preset for better visibility
   - Tuned galaxy effect parameters
   - Implemented proper scaling for both effects
   - Fixed particle emission volumes

3. Performance:
   - Implemented proper 60fps update timer
   - Added performance monitoring
   - Fixed frame rate issues
   - Added proper cleanup on completion

## Next Steps
1. Begin work on next major project phase
2. Consider additional particle effect types
3. Fine-tune effect parameters based on real-world testing
4. Document performance characteristics
