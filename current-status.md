# Current Status

## December 8, 2023
- Completed migration of MusicService to PulsarSymphony module structure
- Successfully moved and updated core types in MusicKitWrappers.swift
- Started updating app views to use new PulsarSymphony module
- Fixed namespace issues in core service files

### In Progress
- Updating app views to use PulsarSymphony (ContentView.swift updated)
- Resolving linter errors related to module imports
- Need to complete view updates for Gallery, Authorization, and other views

## Welcome Animation
- Improved particle system with standardized bounds (Â±12.5 units)
- Optimized animation phases for more natural transitions
- Particles now spawn around user in globe formation
- Center pull phase reuses existing particles
- Fixed particle vanishing issues with expanded boundaries

## Technical Status
- Removed duplicate AetherParticles implementation
- Standardized particle system bounds across all presets
- Improved animation continuity between phases
- Core functionality maintained with better consistency

## Known Issues
- Platform availability linter errors need addressing
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning
- Particle counts and emission rates may need adjustment

## Next Steps
- Complete view updates to use PulsarSymphony
- Resolve remaining linter errors
- Test integration with updated module structure
- Address remaining linter errors
- Verify animation timing against UX specifications
- Test performance with increased particle counts
- Consider additional particle effects for other views
