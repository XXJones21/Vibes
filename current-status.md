## Current Status (December 5, 2023)

### Today's Progress
- âœ… Completed WelcomeAnimation implementation:
  - Added text path generation using SF Pro Bold
  - Implemented particle sampling (300 points)
  - Added all animation phases:
    1. Firefly Float: Random movement
    2. Center Pull: Gathering particles
    3. Text Formation: "VIBES" text
    4. Stable State: Maintained formation
    5. Final Burst: Dispersion with fade
- âœ… Optimized particle system:
  - 2cm particle size
  - 2.5cm spacing
  - Efficient path sampling
  - Smooth transitions
- âœ… Added proper cleanup and fade-out

### In Progress
- ðŸš§ Testing animation performance
- ðŸš§ Fine-tuning particle parameters
- ðŸš§ Optimizing memory usage

### Tomorrow's Tasks
1. Performance Testing:
   - Test on different devices
   - Monitor frame rates
   - Check memory usage
   - Verify smooth transitions

2. Visual Polish:
   - Adjust particle sizes if needed
   - Fine-tune animation timings
   - Test different color schemes
   - Optimize glow effects

3. Code Cleanup:
   - Add detailed documentation
   - Optimize resource usage
   - Add error handling
   - Implement proper cleanup

### Known Issues
1. Need to verify performance with full particle count
2. Animation timing might need adjustment
3. Text positioning needs testing in different orientations

### Next Steps
1. Complete performance testing
2. Implement vector logo replacement
3. Add animation customization options
