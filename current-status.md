# Current Status (December 9, 2023)

## AetherParticles Module
- Fixed particle motion system to respect individual effect configurations
- Resolved component override issues in NexusSystem and PulseSystem
- Improved effect behaviors for galaxy and fireflies presets
- Added proper configuration inheritance and debug logging

## Current Focus
1. Testing distinct particle behaviors:
   - Galaxy disk formation
   - Fireflies floating motion
   - Component state persistence

2. System Stability:
   - Component integration
   - Configuration management
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. Verify effect behaviors in different scenarios
2. Reintroduce complex physics gradually
3. Enhance debug visualization
4. Optimize performance
5. Add more configuration options

## Known Issues
- See current-issues.md for detailed list
- Component state management needs monitoring
- Performance impact needs assessment
