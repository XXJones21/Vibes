   - Added QuartzCore import for proper timing

2. Effect Refinements:
   - Adjusted fireflies preset for better visibility
   - Tuned galaxy effect parameters
   - Implemented proper scaling for both effects
   - Fixed particle emission volumes

3. Performance:
   - Implemented proper 60fps update timer
   - Added performance monitoring
   - Fixed frame rate issues
   - Added proper cleanup on completion

## December 14, 2023 Update
- Implemented comprehensive DocC documentation structure
- Created detailed documentation for core components:
  - PulseEffect documentation with complete API reference
  - PulseParticles documentation with usage examples
  - FirefliesEffect documentation with configuration details
  - GalaxyEffect documentation with implementation notes
