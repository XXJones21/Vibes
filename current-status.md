# Current Status

## Welcome Animation
- Improved particle system with standardized bounds (Â±12.5 units)
- Optimized animation phases for more natural transitions
- Particles now spawn around user in globe formation
- Center pull phase reuses existing particles
- Fixed particle vanishing issues with expanded boundaries

## Technical Status
- Migrated to AetherParticles module
- Standardized particle system bounds across all presets
- Improved animation continuity between phases
- Core functionality maintained with better consistency

## Known Issues
- Platform availability linter errors need addressing
- Animation timing may need fine-tuning
- Particle counts and emission rates may need adjustment

## Next Steps
- Address remaining linter errors
- Verify animation timing against UX specifications
- Test performance with increased particle counts
- Consider additional particle effects for other views
